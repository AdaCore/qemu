Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

The installation is automatically performed by the **InstallShield**. You will
be prompted for an installation directory for the simulator and the example
(later referred to as :envvar:`%GNATEMULATOR_INSTALL_DIR%`).

If you are using **GNATEmulator** for **VxWorks 653** then once the product
is installed, you should install the BSP in the **Wind River Platform for
Safety-Critical ARINC 653** installation along with the default ones.
In order to do that you need to copy the
:file:`%GNATEMULATOR_INSTALL_DIR%\\share\\gnatemulator\\ppc-vx653\\bsp\\qemu`
directory in :file:`%WIND_HOME%\\vxworks653-2.2.2\\target\\config\\qemu`.
Note that the target PATH may be slighty different depending on your version of
**VxWorks 653**.

Setting your environment
------------------------

In order to set your environment for **GNATEmulator** you need to do:

.. code-block:: bat

  set PATH=%GNATEMULATOR_INSTALL_DIR%\bin;%PATH%

Where :envvar:`%GNATEMULATOR_INSTALL_DIR%` is the root directory of your
installation.

If you need to build your own devices using **GNATBus**, then you should
also do:

.. code-block:: bat

  set ADA_PROJECT_PATH=%GNATEMULATOR_INSTALL_DIR%\lib\gnat;%ADA_PROJECT_PATH%

Note that if **GNATEmulator** has been installed in the same location as your
native compiler then you don't need to set :envvar:`ADA_PROJECT_PATH`
environment variable.
