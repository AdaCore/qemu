Running the Leon Bareboard example
**********************************

This tutorial shows how to compile an interactive example and run it on qemu.

Compiling the example
=====================

The example consists of 3 small ada units:

  * hello.adb, the main subprogram.
  * uart.ads and uart.adb which does the I/O using the uart.

To compile, simply invoke gnatmake::

 leon-elf-gnatmake -O --RTS=ravenscar-sfp hello

The option '-O' is used to optimize the code generated,
the option '--RTS=ravenscar-sfp' selects the small foot print ravenscar profile
and 'hello' is the name of the main unit.

Running the example
===================

To launch the example just run::

  leon-elf-gnatemu hello

GNATEmulator will automatically load the ELF file (:file:`hello`) and start execution at the
entry point.

Here is a quick run scenario::

    Menu:
    1) Hello
    2) Bye
    3) Quit
    You choice: 
    1
    hello
    Menu:
    1) Hello
    2) Bye
    3) Quit
    You choice: 
    2
    bye
    Menu:
    1) Hello
    2) Bye
    3) Quit
    You choice: 
    3
    qemu: fatal: Trap 0x80 while interrupts disabled, Error state

(The double trap which is an error is used to stop the simulator).


Redirecting the uart
====================

It is possible to redirect the uart to a tcp port::

  leon-elf-gnatemu hello -serial tcp::1234,server

This will redirect uart1 to the tcp port 1234 of localhost.  With the 'server'
option, qemu will wait for the tcp connection.
