About GNATEmulator
------------------

Simulators are useful tools in many respects. Installation, setup and
deployment to a development team will prove to be easier and quicker than with
a real target. Simulator usage on a native platform will also bring more
flexibility in the development of the application.

GNATEmulator is particularly suited for functional testing and unit
testing. The product comes with a complete simulation environment and related
BSP for non bareboard systems such as VxWorks 653. It allows for efficient 
target code execution. It simulates a simple board and does not aim at 
complete board simulation. This should be mostly transparent to the application 
developer as the differences between the real target and the simulator should
be handled and hidden by the platform provider.

Product Content
---------------

The product is made of three components:

 * **The Simulator**: This is the heart of the product. The main tool is
   called :file:`gnatemu` and is prefixed by the relevant target name.
   Under the hood it relies on **QEMU** processor and board simulator.
   **GNATEmulator** efficiently runs the executable: the
   target code is translated on the fly and basic block by basic block to
   the host processor. The translated code is then kept in a cache so that
   no new translation is required when the execution goes over a basic
   block that has already been executed.
   An important point to keep in mind is that **GNATEmulator** is translating
   and executing instructions as fast as possible and thus won't be cycle
   accurate. The clock used by **GNATEmulator** is the host system clock.
   Timing events are thus dependent on the system clock.

 * **The BSP**: On non bareboard systems, we might provide a BSP whenever it
   is necessary. This is the case for example on **VxWorks 653**. On that
   target we provide a **BSP** called ``qemu`` that should be installed in
   your **Wind River Platform for Safety-Critical ARINC 653** installation.
   This allow to instanciate a board that provides one UART (serial link),
   one ethernet controller, a timer, a ROM and 128Mo of RAM.

 * **The examples**: For each supported platforms we provide examples that
   can be used as a reference for further development with **GNATEmulator**
